<h2>Your Church is Probably Broken.</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Even if it's Working Great for You.</p>
<p class="desc">The perspective of a Christian Computer Science Professor</p>

<p>	My sophomore year of college, my major required me to take a Java programming course. I was hooked. 
I changed my major and have since taught Computer Science at various universities. Whenever people would 
hint that putting beginners in a Java course was too much, I would respond that it worked for me.</p>
<p>My experience with church was much the same. I enjoyed good relationships, got spiritual advice, was 
checked on when I was absent, got invited to dinners, had meals brought when I was sick, etc. When my 
friend who was just as faithful (though less visible) was hit by a car and out for two months and nobody 
noticed, I figured it was somehow her fault. When an unusual guy told me the pastor was the only one the talk to 
him, when someone suddenly got a divorce, when people popped up with addictions or depression, these 
people were to blame. They should have come more often, connected more, sought help, studied the Bible more. And 
I was right. Good Christians do those things. But is church meant to help only the good Christians?</p>
<p>A lady at a college curriculum development workshop rejected the "it worked for me" argument, saying, "All of 
you have Ph.D.'s. You are not the average students. No matter what you do, the good students will figure it out. 
What about the other students?" 
And won't good Christians be okay no matter what you do? Can't they be the only Christian missionaries in atheist 
lands? or glorify God from prison? But what about the ones with wrong priorities who show up only Sunday morning?
 Don't we want them to grow into good Christians, too? Sunday morning is a 2Â½&ndash;hour block&mdash;as much as a week of a 
 university course. Is that time being used to help weak Christians grow? or is it structured to give everyone what 
 one unsaved person characterized to me as "a good churchy feel"?</p>
<p>We spend a half hour of our best-attended church time&mdash;with free child care&mdash;on announcements, welcome, 
listening to an offertory, hand shaking, and specials. During the greeting time, will a struggling Christian 
volunteer, "My wife and I haven't spoken in two days"? The response is usually that if you have a problem, you should 
coordinate another day and find child care. That's not what Sunday morning is for. Serious church content is on 
Sunday night, Wednesday night, Bible study, one-on-one discipleship, group dinners, coming early, staying late. 
If you aren't doing church things 7 hours a week, it's your problem.</p>
<p>After a move to a new area, I discovered how people not in the "in" group feel. We had attended one church for two 
months and wanted some spiritual counsel. I called the church office several times and my messages were ignored, 
presumably because of my out-of-state number. When I left a more pushy message, a polite lady called to apologetically 
let me know that they would not schedule a meeting with any church leader for a non-member, nor give any recommendations 
for whom to talk to. I could try to catch the pastor on Sunday after the large church emptied out. When I replied that 
such as task would be difficult with small children, she responded sympathetically that it was tough but she hoped to see 
me Sunday. She can't be faulted. Church resources are limited, and she didn't know me from Adam. But we won't be back.</p>
<p>Looking back, all we needed was a spiritual relationship with someone to discuss life with. Yet two months of 
regularly attending that church, filled with good Christians and led by an excellent preacher, had afforded only 
polite acquaintances who did not appear to notice when we left.</p>
<p>As a professor, I know class time is valuable and that almost no students show up for office hours or optional 
tutoring sessions. I use the time for vital things students can't or won't do on their own. I explain tricky concepts 
they are likely to miss. I have students find project partners and exchange contact information. If many students will 
need guidance to get started on a project, I spend 10 minutes of class time having eveyone work on the project.</p>

<p>Similarly, what is vital for Christians and won't happen on their own time? Certainly we need "public reading, 
exhortation, and teaching" (1 Timothy 4:13). But Hebrews 10:25 says we are to assemble for the purpose of encouraging 
each other. Typically no service time is spent on personal spiritual encouragement. During the break between services, 
do the majority of people discuss spiritual problems in their lives? How about less open people who don't like 
to bring up their struggles in casual conversations? </p>

<p>One particular paper on introductory computer science argued that if Java was so good for beginners, why were so 
many papers published on how this or that university made it work? Similarly, if our current church structure is 
working so well, why do Christians regularly tell me how they make church work for them? "Well, I meet with Cindy for 
Tuesday lunch." "Mary and I text each other about our devotions each morning." "Thursday morning Bible study really 
helps me." What about people who don't have the luxury of making friends easily or of having flexible schedules?</p>

<p>There is already a time every week we all get together. Let's use it to do what Christians are supposed to do: bear 
each other's burdens (Galatians 6:2), confess our sins to one another and pray for one another (James 5:16), 
encourage each other (Hebrews 3:13, 10:25), love each other (John 15:12), honor each other (Romans 12:10), 
live in harmony (Romans 15:5), instruct each other (Romans 15:14), build each other (1 Thess. 5:11). We could 
carve out 45 minutes from the morning service, break into small groups, and have every single person talk about 
spiritual things&mdash;something we can't do at home and are commanded to be doing regularly. The struggling 
Christians would not be able to hide in the back and complain that no one talked to them. People who need counsel 
from a leader could do so during that time block. Some people might feel awkward being forced to live out Christian 
unity on Sunday morning, which likely means they haven't been living it out at all. We can read our Bibles, study, 
and pray at home, but we cannot do all the "one another's" of Scripture at home. Let's start using church time 
for this vital church function. After all, even if the good Christians are doing okay, we can all improve by 
intentionally doing things well. &mdash;<a href="mailto:justsarah@outlook.com">S. Gothard</a>
