<img <img alt="The First Noel. 1.The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Refrain:
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel!
Born is the King of Israel.

2.They lookÃ¨d up and saw a star 
Shining in the east, beyond them far; 
And to the earth it gave great light, 
And so it continued both day and night. 

3.And by the light of that same star, 
Three wise men came from country far; 
To seek for a king was their intent, 
And to follow the star wherever it went. 

4.This star drew nigh to the northwest, 
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest; 
And there it did both stop and stay 
Right over the place where Jesus lay. 

5.Then entered in those wise men three, 
Full rev'rently upon their knee, 
And offered there in his presence 
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. 

6.Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heav'nly Lord,
Who made the heaven's and earth of naught,
And with his blood our life has bought."
